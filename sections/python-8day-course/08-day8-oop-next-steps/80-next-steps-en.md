# Best Practices to Remember

## Code Quality

```python
# Use descriptive names
# Good
user_age = 25
calculate_total_price()

# Bad
x = 25
calc()

# Follow PEP 8 style guide
# Use 4 spaces for indentation
# Max line length: 79 characters
# Use snake_case for functions and variables
# Use PascalCase for classes

# Write docstrings
def calculate_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle
    """
    return 3.14159 * radius ** 2

# Use type hints (Python 3.5+)
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Handle errors appropriately
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    log_error(e)
    handle_gracefully()
```

## Project Organization

- **Growing** - New tools emerge constantly
- **Rewarding** - Build real solutions to real problems

## Remember:

1. **Everyone started where you are** - Even experts were beginners
2. **Google is your friend** - Looking things up is normal
3. **Practice daily** - Consistency beats intensity
4. **Build projects** - Learning by doing is most effective
5. **Join communities** - Learn from and help others
6. **Don't give up** - Debugging is 80% of programming
7. **Have fun** - Enjoy the journey!

## The Python Philosophy

```python
import this
```

The Zen of Python:

- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Readability counts
- There should be one obvious way to do it
